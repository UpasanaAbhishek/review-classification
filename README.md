# review-classification
Aiming to build a text classifier using Python packages. 

So far, I've only prepared the data for classification and fit a Naive Bayes classifier.

### Citing the paper for the dataset:

Maas, A., Daly, R., Pham, P., Huang, D., Ng, A., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (pp. 142â€“150). Association for Computational Linguistics

Please unzip the data files before using the code, or use the prepared data in the "data" folder.
